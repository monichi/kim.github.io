			<p class="text-center font-weight-bold"> When boredom strikes or when I'm having my free time, watching K-drama is my way of unwinding.<br>
				With various genre, it's just worthy to watch more and more and more of K-dramas!<br>
				It is fascinating to the point that each time I am watching, I wanted to finish it until dawn but that's bad.<br>
				So, the moment that I wake up, I will continue where I stopped and be immerse again with the flow of the drama.<br>

			<p class="bg-dark text-white text-center font-weight-bolder">This Korean drama is my number 1 and favorite of all the dramas that I've watched.<br>
			My favorite genre is comedy and it's one of the reasons why I watched it.<br>
			Another thing is, just by reading the synopsis before watching, I was kind of intrigued; it catched my attention so much that I instantly go for it!<br>
			It is nice, beautiful, unique, cool, and just mind-blowing!<br>
			I can't stop laughing when a certain scenario is uncontrollably epic!<br>

					<img src="arthdal.jpg" class="mx-auto d-block rounded" alt="rounded-circle"  width="315" height="250"><br>
			<p class="bg-dark text-white text-center font-weight-bolder">At first, I was hesitant to watch this drama since it's not my usual genre.<br>
				I thought that it was boring because of the fact that the drama's setting is ancient or historical. Plus, the synopsis or the description of the drama is quite confusing.<br>
				But when I started watching it, I was like, "wow, what a good start!" I want more of this drama.<br>
				It was just so intense that I was a bit mad since there is a season 2 of it and the last season was a cliffhanger.<br>
				The sceneries just took my breath away.<br>
				The casts are so amazing in acting. The plot is beyond the level and the twists are just so nerve-wracking!<br>
				All in all, this drama is 10000000/10! Absolutely perfect!<br>

			<h1 class="text-info text-center font-italic">Chicago Typewriter (2017)</h1>
					<img src="chicago.jpg" class="mx-auto d-block img-thumbnail " alt="img-thumbnail" ><br>
			<p class="bg-dark text-white text-center font-weight-bolder">Chicago Typewriter is considered as an "underrated drama" Maybe because it was not that popular until now.<br>
				But for me, it is one of the most outstanding drama ever! I haven't watched something like this before.<br>
				The past is connected in the present which makes it quite unique.<br>
				It is seperately have its own flow of story but seeking for a single purpose or reason.<br>
				It's just sad that I only discovered this drama this year but well, it was mesmerizing.<br>
				This is a must-watch drama!<br>

				<img src="vincenzo.jpg" class="mx-auto d-block img-fluid" alt="img-fluid" width="220" height="300"><br>
			<p class="bg-dark text-white text-center font-weight-bolder">When the second semester ends last year, this was the first drama that I've watched for the past months.<br>
				I saw it in facebook and users were hyped with it. That's why I watched it that instant.<br>
				The first part of the movie was cool and tragic but when I was in the middle part of it, it was even cooler and more intense!<br>
				It is an action and comedy drama that's why I like it so much.<br>
				Moreover, the actors are wonderful. The plot twist is a hundred percent!<br>
				I wish there will be a season 2 of this...<br>
